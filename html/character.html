                <h1>Akuma</h1>
                <p>Akuma's appearance resembles that of a Nio, one of a pair of guardians that symbolically protects Buddhist temples and other establishments against negative influences. Akuma's belligerence is a direct, and likely deliberate, contrast to the purpose of the Nio. Both Ibuki's and Yun's winquotes against him in Second Impact reference the Nio; Ibuki is reminded of the similarly-themed Shishi lions, while Yun jokingly attempts to recall if he saw Akuma at a temple before the match. His unique stage is adorned with Nio statues in the background to reinforce his connection to them.</p>

Despite being a once great prize boxer, Balrog has intentionally cheated in his fights whenever he felt like it, and has even killed one of his opponents (though by accident).</p>

                <p>Cammy is a strong, forceful, determined, and pertinacious young woman with a firm sense of justice, who is extremely polite, friendly, respectful, and enthusiastic towards those whom she knows and cares about including Delta Red, Chun-Li or Guile and even helping others she barely knew like Ryu, but can be very brutal and sometimes condescending to those whom she dislikes such as M. Bison or Vega. She refuses to go down without a fight, using her extensive training from both Delta Red and Shadaloo to her advantage in defeating her enemies. Enemies are usually aware of the threat Cammy presents, and few are foolish enough to underestimate her.</p>

                <p>Fei Long is very serious most of the time with a calm exterior.

He is full of fighting spirit and takes great pride in his fighting style Hitenryu, which he seeks to honor in all ways possible: He despises all that is evil.</p>
